# Visualisation_Excel_Plotly
Basic quick connection from Excel Spreadsheet to Plotly Chart


## Context: 
Excel charts have limited zoom and interactivity options.

Plotly charts are more adapted and ergonomic for medium to big amount of datas

However, most people work with Excel and do not master python and don't know how to plot charts with plotly from code.

Even if they do, it's always wasted time and lot of frustration to export data from Excel, open it with python and plot with an adequate visualisation solution.

## Objective of this tool: 
Drastically simplify the process, by allowing the user to open a Plotly Charth with one click from a selection of data in Excel


## How to install it:

If you have python installed:

 -Download the folder, paste it in the desired location in your computer (e.g. C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local)
- The path shouldn't contain any whitespace character. This folder cannot be moved after the setup is done.
- Run setup.py and follow the steps described in the .xlsx

If you don't have python installed: 

- I made an exe with the python scripts > available here (too heavy for Github)
- It's a bit heavier so you will need a few minutes to downolad and unzip it, but then it works totally fine!
- Same procedure as before. Just run the setup.exe and follow the instructions
